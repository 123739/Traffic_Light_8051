# Traffic_Light_8051
A simulation of a traffic light control system using the 8051 microcontroller and timers.

# Traffic Light System using 8051 Microcontroller
This project simulates a traffic light control system using the 8051 microcontroller. The system uses timer-based delays to control red, yellow, and green LEDs in a timed sequence.

## Features:
- Timed light switching using embedded delay functions
- Real-time simulation of traffic signal behavior
- Easily modifiable delay cycles

## Tools Used:
- 8051 Microcontroller
- Keil uVision 5 (Embedded C)
- Proteus for simulation

## Files Included (to be added):
- `four-waytraffic.c` – Embedded C source code
- `trafficlight.pdpsrj` – Proteus simulation file
- `traffic_light_simulation.mp4` – Simulation result video

## Notes:
This is a fully simulated project designed as part of embedded systems training during internship.
